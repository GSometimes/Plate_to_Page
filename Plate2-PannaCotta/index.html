                <p class="text">Welcome to plate 2 of “Plate to Page” where I take a dish I’ve made, enjoyed or a suggestion and make a page dedicated to that dish. I continue this series with another dessert that is very special to me, a layered panna cotta. It’s special to me because it is another one of the last desserts I made before becoming a developer. Alongside the yuzu meringue tart it was another dessert that I made in preparation to go for my first Michelin Star.</p>
                <br><p class="text">Panna cotta itself is an extremely popular dish that is essentially a blank canvas. The way I chose to prepare mine is creating a fruity and slightly boozy version of the dessert. It is a vanilla panna cotta that is paired with a sake jelly, raspberry and lychee coulis and topped with fresh raspberries and lychees. It’s a cocktail turned into decadent dessert.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>Preparing the Pastry</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the flour, sugar, salt, and butter to food processor and pulse until it looks like sand. Add egg yolk and water and mix until dough comes together. Press dough together until smooth ball of dough has formed. Cover in plastic to rest in fridge for 20 mins.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Baking the Tart Shells</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Place dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll until 5mm thick. For this part you can use either a 9 inch loose bottom pan or 8cm mini tart tins, this specific recipe will be for the mini tarts. Place the tins on dough and cut around the rim, leaving 2-3cm extra around the edges. Carefully place the dough into the tin and gently press the dough into it. Trim any excess dough and prick the base with a fork. Place tart shells into the fridge for 30 mins. </li>
                    <li>Cut out squares with parchment paper to a size that is slightly larger than the tins and line the tins with them. Fill the parchment paper with baking beans or rice and blind bake them for 10 minutes. After the initial 10 minutes, remove the parchment paper and beans/rice and back for another 5-10 minutes until shell is lightly golden. Set Aside to Cool.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Preparing the Filling and Assembly</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill a small saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer on the stove. Combine the lemon juice, zest and yuzu juice In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs until smooth and fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Place the bowl over the saucepan and whisk the egg mixture for about 2 minutes until it has slightly thickened. Pour in half of the juice mixture and whisk for another 5-10 minutes, or until the mixture starts to thicken again, pour in the remaining mixture and whisk for another 10-15 minutes until mixture is thick and glossy.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and add butter one cube at a time until all butter has been melted and incorporated. Strain liquid and pour into a pitcher and cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>To Assemble the tarts just pour the yuzu curd into the tart shells and chill for at least 1 hour or until the curd has completely set. Serve and enjoy!</li>

            <h2 class="heading">What is Yuzu?</h2>
            <p class="text">Yuzu is a traditional Japanese citrus fruit that has been used to season local cuisine from old times. Unlike a tangerine that is eaten as it is, yuzu is normally used to bring out the flavor and fragrance of Japanese cuisine. A distinctive refreshing aroma is the main feature of yuzu. Although both its juice and peel are full of aroma, its peel contains high levels of aroma constituents and can be finely grated and sprinkled over raw or grilled fish to enhance the flavor. The yuzu produced in Japan have an unrivaled, rich aroma, having been cultivated mostly in inland mountain areas, where there is a significant temperature gap between daytime and nighttime.</p>
