                <p class="text">Welcome to plate 2 of “Plate to Page” where I take a dish I’ve made, enjoyed or a suggestion and make a page dedicated to that dish. I continue this series with another dessert that is very special to me, a layered panna cotta. It’s special to me because it is another one of the last desserts I made before becoming a developer. Alongside the yuzu meringue tart it was another dessert that I made in preparation to go for my first Michelin Star.</p>
                <br><p class="text">Panna cotta itself is an extremely popular dish that is essentially a blank canvas. The way I chose to prepare mine is creating a fruity and slightly boozy version of the dessert. It is a vanilla panna cotta that is paired with a sake jelly, raspberry and lychee coulis and topped with fresh raspberries and lychees. It’s a cocktail turned into decadent dessert.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>Raspberry Coulis</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the flour, sugar, salt, and butter to food processor and pulse until it looks like sand. Add egg yolk and water and mix until dough comes together. Press dough together until smooth ball of dough has formed. Cover in plastic to rest in fridge for 20 mins.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Panna Cotta</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Put the milk into a saucepan and set over medium heat and bring to a boil. In a separate bowl whisk together egg yolks and sugar. Pour the hot milk slowly into the egg and sugar mixture, whisking continuously to combine. <span>You want to make sure you do this slowly otherwise you’ll end up with scrambled eggs and have to start over.<span></li>
                    <li>Cut out squares with parchment paper to a size that is slightly larger than the tins and line the tins with them. Fill the parchment paper with baking beans or rice and blind bake them for 10 minutes. After the initial 10 minutes, remove the parchment paper and beans/rice and back for another 5-10 minutes until shell is lightly golden. Set Aside to Cool.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sake Jelly</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Put sugar and 100ml of sake into a saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar has completely dissolved. Once the sugar has dissolved remove the sake from the heat. Remove the gelatin from the cold water and squeeze the excess liquid. Add gelatin to the mixture and stir until it has dissolved completely. Add the remaining 400ml of sake to the mixture and set aside to cool, but not set. (See Assembly)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Assembly</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assembly is going to take time so I would not recommend doing this last minute. To build this dessert you will need a specialty cocktail glass, as seen in the picture, or any glassware of your choosing. Before pouring in the panna cotta mixture you will need to set the glassware to an angle in a stable position to ensure the panna cotta sets properly (and no mess is made). Pour in the panna cotta mixture roughly two thirds of the way up the glass and place in your cooler until it has set enough to be able stay in place when the glass is upright, approximately 15-20 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Once the panna cotta has set enough you’ll place the glass upright and pour in the sake mixture about half of the way up and place back in the cooler until it has set completely. After the jelly has set completely you can add the raspberry coulis on top of the sake jelly, garnish, and you are ready to serve and enjoy!</li>

            <h2 class="heading">What is Yuzu?</h2>
            <p class="text">Yuzu is a traditional Japanese citrus fruit that has been used to season local cuisine from old times. Unlike a tangerine that is eaten as it is, yuzu is normally used to bring out the flavor and fragrance of Japanese cuisine. A distinctive refreshing aroma is the main feature of yuzu. Although both its juice and peel are full of aroma, its peel contains high levels of aroma constituents and can be finely grated and sprinkled over raw or grilled fish to enhance the flavor. The yuzu produced in Japan have an unrivaled, rich aroma, having been cultivated mostly in inland mountain areas, where there is a significant temperature gap between daytime and nighttime.</p>
